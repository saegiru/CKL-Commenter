This script takes a completed STIG checklist file and copies the status over to a new checklist. It also copies the old comments and adds new text comments
based on user inputs. The initials, date, location of old and new checklists are logged
the Vulnerability numbers for both the old and new checklists are compared and it is also logged if a vulnerability appears or disappears from the new checklist
Any changes from the old checklist are set to Not Reviewed status and appended with a message to review the vulnerability.
